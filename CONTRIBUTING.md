# Contributing to this cookbook
Pull requests are welcome. Please follow this guidelines:
 - Create a new branch and develop from within it.
 - Test your changes using "kitchen verify" and "cookstyle ." from the root of the cookbook (i.e. /home/user1/cookbooks/cobbler3/).
 - Document test results with screenshots - include them in your PR.
 - Be civil - I'm open to ideas and suggestions, however there's a small possibility I may disagree or offer alternatives.
 - When opening a PR, Github actions will perform some integration tests as a last ditch gate for issues. THIS DOES NOT REPLACE LOCAL TESTING. Github Action Minutes ARE LIMITED.

Requirements for developing and testing locally:
 - Ensure latest version of Chef Workstation is installed. 
 - Ensure GIT is installed and configured.
